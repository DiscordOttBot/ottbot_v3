# Ottbot v3

The discord.py community at the time wasn't very welcoming to beginners so I
tried coding bots in different languages. At the time I was learning javascript
and rust so I tried the respective libraries.

I didn't get very far because I was unfimilar with JS and writing rust took a long
time, but I thought I should still archive these somehow.
